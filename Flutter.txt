----------- Flutter : Moble App Dev ----------

1. Install GIT and powershell idf not present on the machine
2.Download and install flutter on https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started or search and install "Flutter" with dart code in VSCode command panel
 
  - On the web site, in section "Install the Flutter SDK#", click tab "Download and Install" to download "flutter-windows*-stable.zip"
 
  - Unzip in a folder like c:\programs\flutter and add c:\programs\flutter\bin in the windows path of the machine


------------ Flutter with Android Studio ----------

Check flutter is located using :

	c:\> where flutter dart or 
	c:\> flutter doctor				<--- Install missing softs in red 

NB : Install missing softs starting by "Android Studio" and using "Android Studio", click on "More Actions" --> "SDK Manager" -> Menu SDK Tools 
     in the welcome page to select other products to install : 
		- Android SDK command-line tools
		- Google USD Driver   (helps send app on mobile using usb cable)

		To install " Android toolchain", if you installed Android in a custom folder "C:\Programs\Android", enter :
		
		c:\> flutter config --android-sdk C:\Programs\Android 
		
		To accept licenses :
		
		c:\> flutter doctor --android-licenses			<--- Enter y to accept each time prompted
		
NB : We don''t need here to install Visual Studio which is necessary for Win form apps (not vscode)

---------- Install Flutter plugin in Android Studio

We need to install a plugin in Android Studio to allow dev with Flutter. 

 - In Android Studio, click on plugin in left menu and search and install Flutter. It will ask or will automatically install dart
 - Restart IDE 

Start new project Flutter :

Click on "New project flutter"  --> Select Flutter in left panel -->  select Flutter SDK or install folder (C:\Programs\flutter)


We need to enable dev mode on our android mobile :

	- On mobile settings, enter search and select build number. Click many times on build numer or "Numero de version" to be
	  ask to enter password or mobile scheme. You will receive the message "Developer mode enabled"

	- On Settings, scroll to the botton to select "Development options". Scroll to enable "Debug USB2"
	- Connect the mobile android to the machine and notice mobile name appears in the top list "Select Device"  
	- Click on RUN button to lauch app on android and see the demo app on mobile
	
---------- Run the app on an emulator -----

In the top right planel, click on "Device Manager" icon and click "+" to create a virtual device. 

In the select hardware, select "Phone" -> "Pixel 5" -> Select and download the recommended OS (API 35) and finish

In the "Select device" list, select the virtual device created and run the demo. Flutter will run the app on the virtual device 

NB: You have to free enough space (> = 10) on disk to avoid error like "The emulator process for avd has terminated" 

------------ Flutter with VSCODE ---------------------------

Open vscode and install plugins flutter (which installs dart)

Open a new terminal in flutter dir and create an application called "flutproj" : 

  PS> cd C:\Cours\Flutter
  PS> flutter create flutproj
  
		....

		In order to run your application, type:

		$ cd flutproj
		$ flutter run		
	
		Your application code is in flutproj\lib\main.dart.

		The configured version of Java detected may conflict with the Gradle version in your new Flutter app.

		To keep the default AGP version Gradle version 8.3, download a compatible Java version
		(Java 17 <= (Java 17 <= compatible Java version < Java 21) Java version < Java 21). Configure this Java version
		globally for Flutter by running:

		  flutter config --jdk-dir=<JDK_DIRECTORY>

		....


	PS C:\Cours\Flutter> cd flutproj
	PS C:\Cours\Flutter\flutproj> flutter run		<-- Keep your mobile connected via usb to see demo app launced in mobile
	


	Open the application folder via File --> Open folder --> click on "lib" --> click on "main.dart" to see app code

	Check on the right bottom the device selection list
